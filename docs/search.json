(2) Despite a higher incidence of older females in couples, the age gap is relatively lower than that of older male couples. (3) Some of the movies include same-gender couples, which can make this graph misleading. In the case where the couple is woman-woman, older female will show up regardless.

In December of 2020, I graduated from Clemson University with a Bachelor’s in Biological Sciences. I currently work under the advisement of Dr. Erin Lipp, where my research addresses the cross section between environmental and public health.

My first exposure to coding using R was last Spring, when I completed an intensive computation course that helped me gain familiarity with R Markdown, it’s syntax, and the creation of figures using ggplot2. I can comfortably filter through data and create simple figures.\nFrom this course, I hope to become more familiar with coding syntax, and expand upon my ability to produce figures, run models, create websites, work with data, and especially understand when and why we use specific statistical measures."

    "text": "Looking at the data\nTo make sure the data loaded correctly, we will look at the summary measures of the dataframe.\n\nsummary(ga)\n\n      year         cause              state               deaths     \n Min.   :1999   Length:209         Length:209         Min.   :  847  \n 1st Qu.:2003   Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.: 1604  \n Median :2008   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median : 3411  \n Mean   :2008                                         Mean   :11130  \n 3rd Qu.:2013                                         3rd Qu.:14032  \n Max.   :2017                                         Max.   :83098  \n\nstr(ga)\n\ntibble [209 × 4] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ year  : num [1:209] 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 ...\n $ cause : chr [1:209] \"Unintentional injuries\" \"All causes\" \"Alzheimer's disease\" \"Stroke\" ...\n $ state : chr [1:209] \"Georgia\" \"Georgia\" \"Georgia\" \"Georgia\" ...\n $ deaths: num [1:209] 4712 83098 4290 4399 4866 ...\n\n\n\nSome simple exploratory analysis with plots\nLet’s look at a a series of boxplots for each year of only the All Cause deaths in Georgia.\n\n#filter for all causes and pull death column\nACdeaths <- ga %>% \n  filter(cause == \"All causes\") %>% \n  pull(deaths)\n\n#filter for all causes and pull year column\nACyear <- ga %>% \n  filter(cause == \"All causes\") %>% \n  pull(year)\n\n#create boxplot\nboxplot(formula = ACdeaths ~ ACyear)\n\n\n\n\nWhile not very informative, we can see that the death rate for All Causes are increasing with each year. Let’s look at a better representation of the data.\nFirst, I want to look at the top category of injuries for GA over 1999 to 2017. To do this, I will plot the number of deaths for each cause for each year.\n\n#scatter plot of year vs deaths by cause\nggplot(ga, aes(x = year, y = deaths, color = cause)) +\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_line()+\n  scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log\")+\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Paired\")\n\n\n\n\nUnlike with the box plot, the all causes line is not increasing as drastically as the boxplot suggested.Looking at the separated causes of death, we can see from the plot that the top causes are heart disease and cancer in Georgia for this time period. One cause of death that I find interesting is the sharp increase in Alzheimer’s disease around 2013.\nWe can try to fit a model to the Alzheimer’s line to try to predict future trends.\n\n\nLinear model\n\n#filter for alzheimer's disease\nAD <- ga %>% filter(cause == \"Alzheimer's disease\")\n\n#create fit and summary\nfit <- lm(deaths ~ year, data = AD)\nsummary(fit)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = deaths ~ year, data = AD)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-804.16 -337.48   10.23  203.93  879.15 \n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    \n(Intercept) -278310.97   38525.50  -7.224 1.42e-06 ***\nyear            139.67      19.19   7.280 1.29e-06 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 458.1 on 17 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:  0.7571,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.7429 \nF-statistic:    53 on 1 and 17 DF,  p-value: 1.286e-06\n\n\nThe linear model suggests year is a valid predictor of the number of deaths from Alzheimer’s disease with an expected increase of 139.67 deaths per year."
