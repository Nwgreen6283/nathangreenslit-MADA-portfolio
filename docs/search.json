    "text": "My name is Nathan Greenslit and I am a second year Master’s student in the Department of Marine Sciences. In December of 2020, I graduated from Clemson University with a Bachelor’s in Biological Sciences. I currently work under the advisement of Dr. Erin Lipp, where my research addresses the cross section between environmental and public health. I am specifically interested in how environmental fluctuations can impact marine pathogen dynamics in coastal waterways, and how microbial blooms can impact both marine and human health.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have a basal understanding of modern statistical approaches as I have completed a general statistics course during my undergraduate degree and recently completed a Quantitative Methods course past Fall. My first exposure to coding using R was last Spring, when I completed an intensive computation course that helped me gain familiarity with R Markdown, it’s syntax, and the creation of figures using ggplot2. I can comfortably filter through data and create simple figures.\nFrom this course, I hope to become more familiar with coding syntax, and expand upon my ability to produce figures, run models, create websites, work with data, and especially understand when and why we use specific statistical measures."

My activities included leading a team of divers on a series of “outplant” dives, where we would directly restore species of coral (Staghorn, Elkhorn, Massive Starlet Coral) back out onto the reefs of the Upper Middle Keys.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n This is an image from one of my monitoring dives on Alligator Reef, Islamorada, FL. Our Staghorn outplants are accompanied by a loggerhead sea turtle and a barracuda."

The Cause Name variable is a simplified version of the 113 Cause Name (as assigned by the International Classification of Diseases) and the Age-adjusted Death rate (per 100,000 population) is calculated based on the US population in 2000.

Let’s look at a better representation of the data.\nFirst, I want to look at the top category of injuries for GA over 1999 to 2017. To do this, I will plot the number of deaths for each cause for each year.\n\n#scatter plot of year vs deaths by cause\nggplot(ga, aes(x = year, y = deaths, color = cause)) +\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_line()+\n  scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log\")+\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Paired\")\n\n\n\n\nUnlike with the box plot, the all causes line is not increasing as drastically as the boxplot suggested.Looking at the separated causes of death, we can see from the plot that the top causes are heart disease and cancer in Georgia for this time period. One cause of death that I find interesting is the sharp increase in Alzheimer’s disease around 2013.\nWe can try to fit a model to the Alzheimer’s line to try to predict future trends.\n\n\nLinear model\n\n#filter for alzheimer's disease\nAD <- ga %>% filter(cause == \"Alzheimer's disease\")\n\n#create fit and summary\nfit <- lm(deaths ~ year, data = AD)\nsummary(fit)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = deaths ~ year, data = AD)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-804.16 -337.48   10.23  203.93  879.15 \n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.
