## **Background:**

### *Who am I, and what do I do?*

My name is Nathan Greenslit and I am a second year Master's student in the *Department of Marine Sciences*. In December of 2020, I graduated from Clemson University with a Bachelor's in Biological Sciences. I currently work under the advisement of Dr. Erin Lipp, where my research addresses the cross section between environmental and public health. I am specifically interested in how environmental fluctuations can impact marine pathogen dynamics in coastal waterways, and how microbial blooms can impact both **marine and human** health.

### *Previous Statistical and Coding Experience*

I have a basal understanding of modern statistical approaches as I have completed a *general statistics* course during my undergraduate degree and recently completed a *Quantitative Methods* course past Fall.
My first exposure to coding using **R** was last Spring, when I completed an intensive *computation course* that helped me gain familiarity with R Markdown, it's syntax, and the creation of figures using *ggplot2*. I can comfortably filter through data and create simple figures.

From this course, I hope to become more familiar with coding syntax, and expand upon my ability to produce figures, run models, create websites, work with data, and especially understand **when and why we use specific statistical measures**.

## **Interesting Fact:**

Before coming to UGA, I worked with a non-profit based in the Florida Keys that focused on scientific communication and coral restoration. My activities included leading a team of divers on a series of "outplant" dives, where we would directly restore species of coral (Staghorn, Elkhorn, Massive Starlet Coral) back out onto the reefs of the Upper Middle Keys.

**This is a really interesting video where a Computer Scientist explains** *machine learning* **at varying levels of difficulty, ranging from a child to an expert. I think that it is equally as important to disseminate your research as it is to conduct it!.**
