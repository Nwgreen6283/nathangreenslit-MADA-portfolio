`wrangling.qmd` take the data set and removes columns of non interest. 

`exploration.qmd` includes code that explored variables of specific interest that could predict our outcomes of interest: Body Temperature and Nausea. After looking through the variables, Fever was chosen as a predictor variable for the former, and Vomit was chosen for the latter. 

`fitting.qmd` includes code that runs 4 models:
1. A Linear model examining the relationship between Body Temperature and Fever
2. A linear model examining the relationship between Body Temperature and all variables
3. A logistic model examining the relationship between Nausea and Vomit
4. A logistic model examining the relationship between Nausea and all variables.
